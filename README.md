# Caching Game


**Objective:**  
The goal of the "Catching Game" is simple: move your basket left and right to catch falling objects! Each time you catch an object, your score increases. The game continues to get more challenging as the objects fall faster, so you'll need quick reflexes and good timing to keep up.

**How to Play:**  
- Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to move the basket.
- A red circle (representing a falling object) will randomly drop from the top of the game area.
- Catch the falling objects with the basket. When an object reaches the bottom and overlaps with the basket, it is considered "caught," and your score goes up.
- Your score is displayed at the top of the screen and updates every time you catch an object.
- The game speeds up as more objects fall, so stay sharp and try to catch as many as you can!

**Features:**  
- **Simple Controls:** Easy-to-learn arrow key controls for moving the basket.
- **Challenging Gameplay:** Objects fall at random speeds and positions, making each game unique.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your high score to compete against yourself.

Try to catch as many objects as possible before they get away! The more you catch, the higher your score. How long can you keep up with the falling objects?
